# pulsar-python-vprof
A package for Pulsar Editor that shows python profiling results generated by [vprof](https://github.com/nvdv/vprof) Python package.  

### Dependencies
For displaying profiling results: Python  
For generating profiling results: Python and vprof (`pip install vprof`)  

### Usage
Vprof must be run manually in project root directory. Example commands:  
`vprof -o stats.prof -c h main.py`  
Or with arguments: `vprof -o stats.prof -c h "main.py --arg test"`  
`main.py` - example file   
`-c h` - selects heatmap mode  
`-o stats.prof` - output file, the name must be this  
`main.py` will be run same as usual `python main.py`, and when finished vprof will process and generate profiling results in `stats.prof`.  
Vprof will profile all the code that was run and present in project directory. Threading is supported.  
After the results are generated, they can be toggled in Pulsar editor gutter with this command:  
`vprof:toggle` or with default keybinding `Alt-Shift-P`.
